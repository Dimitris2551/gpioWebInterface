# gpioWebInterface

My name is Kleitsiotis Dimitrios
I am a student of computer and electrical engineering in the University of Thessaly in Greece and I have developed this django project.
It runs on a raspberry pi.
It Gives you control of gpio pins over the web.
All you need is a browser.
It is intuitive to use and as simple as it gets.

The instructions for using it can be found here http://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-Web-Interface/
